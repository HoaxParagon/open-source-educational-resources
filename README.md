# open-source-educational-resources
this is a repo all about open source educational resources, as the title suggests. In school I found it difficult to learn from immovable paper and with today's technology, there's little reason to do that any more. Books aren't cheap and a classroom's books could buy a computer and a projector to show animations of mathematics with.


#### THE GOAL
Make a free, professional resource for educators to download, share and show to classrooms to aid instruction of common topics.  

#### WHY?
Because video hosting sites are bandwidth intenstive for schools and may not always be available. This archive can be downloaded once per school, updated as required and shared via USB drives amongst a school's educators. In areas where network connection is not available OR is not apt enough to facilitate education, this archive could be seen as a lifesaver by allowing someone to download it where there is a good connection and allowing for further offline sharing.  

#### DISCORD LINK
[Come discuss on Discord!](https://discord.gg/YyNjzCszZt)

What's needed:  
  Some kind of icon or logo  
  animators  
  teachers  
  quiz/test/paper resource makers  
  collaborators, generally anyone that doesn't fit the first two categories but would still like to do things like  
    voice overs,  
    translations,  
    organization of files/structures,  
    video editors,  
    discord mods?,  
    etc.  
    
I believe that this project can have far reaching impacts and as such it's unpaid; the best things in life are free.  
If you have something you'd like to put into this archive, let me know. Right now, it's probably best to make an issue
  or a pull request with the file.  
I'm looking for similarity and uniformity in the file naming and file type schema. A known good installer for VLC media player will be  
included by default, or, barring their unwillingness or some licencing requirements, some other video platform will be used.  
The plan is to start with animations based in all fields of study from gradeschool onward into college level study.  
There will be NO POLITICS allowed. If you try to upload something involving CRT or any other such racially motivated nonsense
  you will be publically shamed and banned from further uploads pending review.  

I will be curating this archive in my spare time and attempting to get people on board first and foremost. I am not an educator and my animation skills are limited to what I can do in Fusion 360. I will further network with predominate educational Youtubers first in an effort to provide files that I or others think will be most beneficial to students.
